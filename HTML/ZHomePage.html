<H2> The World that Ends in Three Days </H2>

</CENTER>

<H3>

	<P> Termina was in trouble. The moon was plummeting toward the earth, and, in three
 days' time, the world would be destroyed. A young imp known as Skull Kid had snatched 
Majora's Mask from a traveling mask salesman. With the aid of the mask's terrible power, 
his actions had gone from beyond the scope of mischief, and the effects of his pranks 
could be felt all over Termina. The imp's trickery didn't stop there. He also snatched 
Epona and the Ocarina of Time from Link, transforming the Hero into a Deku Scrub.</P>

	<P> After regaining possession of the Ocarina of Time, Link was able to return to his
 original form using a mask. However, the Happy Mask Salesman entreated him to recover 
Majora's Mask. Together with Tatl, who was worried about Skull Kid, Link decided to put 
an end to the imp's excessive meddling. </P>

	<P> Link first found himself in a place called Clock Town. Three days before the local
 carnival, the town was thrown into chaos when the moon began to fall. The shadow of the
	lunar body grew bigger with each passing day. Using the Ocarina of Time, Link was able 
	to rewind the passage of time to three days before the moon fell. He collected a number 
of mysterious masks and righted the unusual changes that had taken place in the world, 
reviving the legendary giants that slept in the four regions of the land. </P>

	<P> The day of destiny had arrived. The Four Giants stretched out their arms and held
 up the moon, stopping it from plunging into the town. However, the mastermind behind 
these events was none other than Majora's Mask. Link pursued the mask to the center of 
the moon. There, a strange battle unfolded. Link transformed into the Fierce Deity and 
	eradicated the threat. </P>

	<P> Majora's Mask was then returned to the Happy Mask Salesman, and the terror caused 
by the falling moon no longer held the world in its grip. As night fell on the third 
day, Clock Town was safe. Link watched the happy citizens enjoying the Carnival of Time. 
The Hero took his leave with Termina, and his whereabouts after that are unknown. </P>
