<H3> Link's is the Ocarina of Time, given to 
him by Princess Zelda. With the ocarina, Link can play a certain song to make things happen, 

as shown below. Link can only use his Ocarina in his human form. When he puts on a transformation 
mask, his ocarina changes to whatever 
instrument that species would play. So when Link turns into 
a Deku, his ocarina turns into the Pipes of Awakening, when he turns into a 
Goron, his ocarina 
turns into drums, when he turns into a Zora, it turns into a guitar. Music has an important role in this game and in
the series in general. The music helps set the mood for each area of Termina LInk visits. Music is also a way the people of Hyrule
connect with the world around them. Guru-Guru constantly plays the same song all day, Pamela and her father play the "Farewell Gibdo" song
to keep the undead away, and when Link wears his Bremen mask, he plays his ocarina to make small creatures follow him. Even outside the game,
The Legend of Zelda has effected different artists. From classic music to electronic music, The Legend of Zelda has been a common theme
among them all. Below are all the songs Link Plays on his ocarina and the music played throughtout the game and IRL. </H3>
