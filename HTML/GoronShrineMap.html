  	<div class="desc">The Goron Shrine is the home of most Gorons during the winter season. The entrance of the Goron Shrine is tightly 
	shut during the winter, and it only stays open for a short amount of time in order to eep the cold from coming inside; however, in 
	the spring, the door is widely open for anyone to come in. The door can only be 
opened by performing the Goron Ground Pound in front 
	of the door. The shrine is a large 
stone structure building around a cavern-like area carved into the mountain. it features 
a chamber 
	where the Goron Elder's Son resides, a main hall, a shop, and a complex 
chandelier. It is used as a central meeting place for the 
	Gorons. </div>
