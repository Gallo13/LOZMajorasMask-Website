    <p><B> The day of destiny had finally arrived. At midnight of the third day, Link goes to face Skull Kid once more. Link summoned the Four 
Giants to stop the moon from destroying Termina. They succeed by holding up the moon with their arms stretched out. Majora then finds 
Skull Kid unworthy and stops controlling him and flies off to the moon. Majora sets out to possess the moon instead. Link fallows Majora 
to the moon. There, on the moon, is a strange place. A large field with a single tree stands in the center. To defeat Majora Link must find 
the last mask, the Deity Mask. With that mask Link can become a fierce, omnipotent being with great power. To get the mask, Link must help 
the Moon Children. Link helps the Moon Children and gets the mask. Link must now face off against Majora. In a terrifying battle, Link and 
a now transformed Majora fight to win the destiny of Termina. Link finally defeats Majora and reunited Tatl and Tael and liberated Skull Kid. 
The Happy Mask Salesman got his mask back and Termina regained its freedom. The people of Termina, on the dawn of a new day, celebrate the 
Carnival of Time. Link then finds a friend in Skull Kid, realizing that that Skull Kid was the same Skull Kid Link met before and taught 
Saria's Song to. Link and Epona rode away and continued on their journey to find Navi. </B></p>
