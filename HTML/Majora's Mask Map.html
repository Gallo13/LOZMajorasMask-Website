<P>Termina is dominated by four regions, to the north, south, east, and west, with Clock Town's Clock Tower at its center. The regions consist of the swampland of Woodfall, the mountains of Snowhead, the ocean of Great Bay, and the canyon of Ikana. The kingdom of Ikana is in ruins, but the other regions are governed by the people who inhabit them.Termina is a strange parallel world, where many of the inhabitants look identical to the people of Hyrule. It is here where Link finds himself after encountering Skull Kid. In t
his land, most of the people are identical to the people of Hyrule. Every year the Terminan races celebrate the Carnival of Time in the central of Clock Town. They do this in honor of the Four Giants who, according to the legend, created the land and still guard it.</P>
